# Deterministic Forcing Implementation Summary

## Overview
I've successfully implemented a comprehensive deterministic forcing module for pygSQuiG that provides various canonical forcing patterns commonly used in turbulence research. This implementation follows agent-2's architectural guidelines and maintains compatibility with the existing codebase.

## Implemented Forcing Patterns

### 1. **Taylor-Green Vortex Forcing**
- Classic pattern: `F = A * sin(k*x) * cos(k*y)`
- Creates steady array of counter-rotating vortices
- Optional time-dependent amplitude (cosine decay)

### 2. **Kolmogorov Flow Forcing**
- Sinusoidal forcing: `F = A * sin(k*y)` or `F = A * sin(k*x)`
- Creates parallel shear layers
- Configurable direction (x or y)

### 3. **Checkerboard Pattern Forcing**
- Alternating sign pattern: `F = A * sign(sin(kx*x) * sin(ky*y))`
- Creates grid of alternating positive/negative regions
- Supports rectangular patterns with different kx, ky

### 4. **Shear Layer Forcing**
- Linear profile: `F = A * y/L` (or x/L)
- Hyperbolic tangent profile: `F = A * tanh((y-y0)/Î´)`
- Configurable center and width for tanh profile

### 5. **Vortex Pair Forcing**
- Gaussian vortices at specified locations
- Supports multiple vortices with individual circulation strengths
- Handles periodic boundary conditions properly

### 6. **Time-Modulated Forcing**
- Wrapper for adding time modulation to any base pattern
- Modulation types: sine, cosine, exponential decay, linear ramp
- Enables oscillating and decaying forcing scenarios

### 7. **Combined Forcing**
- Linear combination of multiple forcing patterns
- Weighted superposition with individual amplitudes

## Key Features

### Architecture
- Abstract base class `DeterministicForcing` for consistent interface
- All patterns follow functional programming style per agent-2's guidelines
- Proper error handling with custom `ForcingError` exception
- Comprehensive validation of input parameters

### JAX Compatibility
- Removed JAX JIT decorators from classes due to hashability constraints
- Pure functional computations suitable for JIT compilation at higher levels
- Compatible with JAX arrays and transformations

### Testing
- Comprehensive test suite with 19 tests covering all patterns
- Tests verify mathematical properties (e.g., symmetry, monotonicity)
- Integration tests with the main solver
- All tests passing with good coverage (81% for deterministic_forcing.py)

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```python
from pygsquig.forcing.deterministic_forcing import KolmogorovForcing

# Create Kolmogorov flow forcing
forcing = KolmogorovForcing(amplitude=0.5, k=4, direction='y')

# Use with solver (requires wrapper for dt parameter)
def forcing_wrapper(theta_hat, **kwargs):
    key = kwargs.get('key', jax.random.PRNGKey(0))
    grid = kwargs['grid']
    return forcing(theta_hat, key, dt, grid)

state = solver.step(state, dt, forcing=forcing_wrapper, key=key, grid=grid)
```

### Factory Functions
```python
# Quick creation of common patterns
forcing = make_taylor_green_forcing(amplitude=1.0, k=2, time_decay=True)
forcing = make_kolmogorov_forcing(amplitude=0.5, k=4, direction='y')
forcing = make_oscillating_forcing(base_pattern='taylor_green', frequency=0.5)
```

## Integration Notes

### Solver Compatibility
The current solver passes forcing functions as `forcing(theta_hat, **kwargs)` where kwargs contains `key` and `grid`, but not `dt`. Deterministic forcing expects `forcing(theta_hat, key, dt, grid)`. 

To bridge this gap, I've:
1. Created wrapper functions in tests and examples
2. Provided a complete example (`deterministic_forcing_example.py`) showing both wrapper approach and custom time-stepping

### Future Improvements
When agent-2's refactoring is complete, consider:
1. Updating solver to pass `dt` to forcing functions
2. Adding @jax.jit decorators to individual computation functions
3. Creating a unified forcing interface that handles both stochastic and deterministic patterns

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `pygsquig/forcing/deterministic_forcing.py` - Main implementation (580 lines)
- `tests/test_deterministic_forcing.py` - Comprehensive tests (477 lines)
- `examples/deterministic_forcing_example.py` - Usage example (125 lines)

### Modified Files
- `pygsquig/forcing/__init__.py` - Added exports for new classes
- `pygsquig/exceptions.py` - Added `ForcingError` exception

## Next Steps
With deterministic forcing complete, the next high-priority tasks are:
1. GPU-specific optimizations and multi-GPU support
2. Adaptive timestepping with CFL control
3. White noise forcing option (building on deterministic forcing framework)
